# Im-So-Hungry

## About üçù

* I built this side project to reduce the food waste in my dorm kitchen.
* This mobile application allows users to search for recipes by telling the app what ingredients they already have available in their pantry. 
* I worked on both the frontend and backend of this app. On the frontend, I coded the screens, components, and the navigation of the app.
* In the backend, I queried Spoonacular's API using Axios to filter recipes by ingredients.
* Tech used is React Native, Axios, Javascript.
